# Deep-Learning-and-Probabilistic-Graphical-Models-for-Optical-Character-Recognition-Errors-Correction
Internship : Mars 2017-September 2017  On deep learning and probabilistic graphical models for optical character recognition 
(OCR) errors correction.

# My task

Design a predictive algorithm  that corrects OCR (Optical Character Recognition) invoices. The latter are scanned documents, often noisy and the resolution is variable. The information in the documents are extracted by OCR. When the quality of the documents is poor, some characters are badly extracted. Many automatic learning methods (Markov models, RNN, CNN) make it possible to detect these errors. The aim of the internship is to benchmark the performance of each learning method.

l intervene on the entire developpement chain of the solution:

-Collection and labelling of data

-Test and design of the most suitable prediction algorithms

-Put it into production in collaboration with the developpers
